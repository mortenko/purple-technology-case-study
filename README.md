#### Purple JS Team Case Study


## frontend (react.js)

### run app:
  - go to currency-app/frontend folder
  - npm i (or npm install)
  - npm run start
  - app is listen on port ```:3000``` on localhost

## backend (node.js)

### run app:
  - go to currency-app/backend folder
  - npm i (or npm install)
  - npm run start
  - app is listen on port ```:5000``` on localhost

### run db (sqlite3):
   - go to currency-app/backend/db folder
   - npm run init-db-script (currency.db file is created)

enjoy!  

--------------------------------
**Requirements:**

For backend use Node.js with any common framework (express,hapi, koa and serverless are all recommended)

- Your API can be based on REST or GraphQLFor frontend we prefer React but you can also use other modern frameworks 
- In the backend, use an external API to get the currency rates.
- The frontend has to communicate only with your custom API.
- **The app should also display the following stats:**
   
   - Most popular destination currency
   - Total amount converted (in USD)
   - Total number of conversion requests made

Make sure the stats are not cleared on restart and are aggregate for all visitors.
This means they have to be calculated and stored in the backend.
 
 Do not use locally installed database. You can use local file, free version of some cloud database or any other method.
 
 Your app should not require any pre-requisites. It should run on any machine with latest LTS version of Node. Alternatively you can create a Docker image.
 
 Additional tipsCurrency rates APIs:
   - https://openexchangerates.org
   - https://currencylayer.com
   - http://fixer.io

Enhancements:
  - Try to use ES6+ and/or typescript. 
  - Split the code into several modules. 
  - Donâ€™t use just one file for the Node server.
  - When building the API, consider it public. Other developers might use it so make sure it's understandable, validate inputs, etc. 
  - Submit your work as a Git repo. 
  - Commit often as you work.Make your work production-ready
  - Expect the app will be later developed further by someone else.
  - Write your code with that in mind.Take a look at the stack we use in our GitHub. You can use  it or take some inspiration from it.
